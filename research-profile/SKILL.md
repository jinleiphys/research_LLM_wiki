name: research-profile
description: Maintain the user's personal research portfolio (projects, papers, ideas, failures, methods, collaborators, talks, reviews, funding) as a structured wiki at ~/research-wiki-personal/. The single-page profile.md is auto-loaded into every new agent session via the harness's import — Claude Code uses @import in CLAUDE.md, Codex CLI symlinks ~/.codex/AGENTS.md to profile.md — so the assistant always knows what the user has worked on, what failed and why, and which methods are theirs. Use to record a project, log a paper, capture an idea, document a failed attempt, update collaborator notes, log a talk or referee work, refresh the profile, or snapshot a CV summary. Trigger on '记一下我做的', '加进我的研究档案', '我有个新研究 idea', '这次没 work, 记一下', '我做过什么', '更新我的 profile', 'log this project', 'add to my portfolio', 'what have I worked on', 'snapshot my research'. Precedence — for forward paths on a stuck problem use idea-pk; for game ideas use game.

# Research Profile Maintenance (Schema v2)

This file is the canonical operational protocol. It is harness-neutral. The skill ships parallel `SKILL.md` (Claude Code entry) and `AGENTS.md` (Codex CLI entry) bodies that mirror each other; if you edit one, edit the other.

**Schema v2 (current)** introduces controlled vocabulary, tag-driven indexing, AUTO-marker profile sections, and an explicit `migrate` path from v1. See [Migration from v1](#7-migrate--bring-existing-pages-up-to-current-schema) below if you have a v1 wiki.

## Why this skill exists

Memory of "what the user has worked on" should not live only in the user's head and in scattered drafts. It should be a curated, persistent, **machine-queryable** artifact that:

1. Auto-loads into every new agent session, so the assistant starts with full context.
2. Captures **failures with reasons** — research's most common scarring is doing the same dead-end twice. The wiki remembers so the user doesn't have to.
3. Makes cross-cutting queries cheap. "What have I done on topic X?" should not require manual grep across years of notes; tag-driven indices answer it in one read.

This is the **factual record** of what the user has done, not a personality simulator.

## Wiki location

Resolution order on every invocation:

1. `RESEARCH_PROFILE_PATH` env var.
2. `~/.research-profile-path` (single-line absolute path).
3. Default: `~/research-wiki-personal/`.

This wiki is **private**. Treat the path with notebook-grade care. Recommend a local + private remote git repo. If the directory does not exist, ask before creating.

## The auto-load mechanism

The single most important file is `<wiki>/profile.md` — a one-page summary structured to fit in <2k tokens. It is auto-loaded into every session via your harness's documented mechanism.

### On Claude Code (uses `@import`)

1. Append `@<wiki>/profile.md` (absolute path) to `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md` (user-level) or `<project>/CLAUDE.md` (project-scoped).
2. First import shows an external-import approval dialog; approve once.
3. Every new session in scope has profile.md content at session start.

### On Codex CLI (uses `~/.codex/AGENTS.md` symlink)

Codex does not support `@import` ([openai/codex#17401](https://github.com/openai/codex/issues/17401)). Use Codex's documented global agent doc directly:

```bash
ln -sfn <wiki>/profile.md ~/.codex/AGENTS.md
```

If `~/.codex/AGENTS.md` already has content, merge it into profile.md's "Working preferences" section first, then symlink. Per-project alternative: `cd <project> && ln -sfn <wiki>/profile.md AGENTS.md`.

`project_doc_fallback_filenames` does NOT work for `~/.codex/profile.md` — that mechanism only walks the project tree, never `~/.codex/`. The `~/.codex/AGENTS.md` symlink is the only reliable global path.

## Controlled vocabulary (the v2 contract)

Tag drift breaks indexing. To prevent it, all tag values come from a controlled vocabulary stored in `<wiki>/CLAUDE.md` (the per-wiki schema file the skill respects). The vocabulary defines six axes:

| Axis | What it tracks | Examples |
|---|---|---|
| `methods` | analytical / numerical / experimental methods | `cdcc`, `iav-cdcc`, `monte-carlo`, `ab-initio` |
| `observables` | physical quantities computed or measured | `breakup-cs`, `fusion-suppression-factor`, `polarization` |
| `codes` | code packages used | `fresco`, `ncsm`, `julia-nucleartoolkit` |
| `topics` | physics themes / open questions | `icf`, `cf-suppression`, `weakly-bound`, `halo-nuclei` |
| `systems` | specific reactions or nuclei | `d+93Nb`, `6Li+209Bi`, `11Li` |
| `collaborators` | people the user works with | `moro`, `phillips`, `furnstahl` |

### Vocabulary file format

Each axis is a YAML map of `slug → entry`:

```yaml
vocabulary:
  methods:
    cdcc:
      canonical: "Continuum-Discretized Coupled Channels"
      aliases: [CDCC, "continuum-discretized", "continuum discretized coupled channels"]
    iav-cdcc:
      canonical: "Ichimura-Austern-Vincent CDCC for transfer/breakup"
      aliases: [IAV-CDCC, "IAV CDCC"]
      parent: cdcc           # iav-cdcc IMPLIES cdcc; index propagates upward
  topics:
    icf:
      canonical: "Incomplete fusion"
      aliases: [ICF, 不完全融合]
  ...
```

- `canonical` — human-readable name. Required.
- `aliases` — alternate spellings (case-insensitive, multi-language). The agent normalizes any alias to the slug. Optional.
- `parent` — hierarchical inclusion. A page tagged with the child slug is auto-included in indices for the parent. Optional.

A starter `templates/CLAUDE.md` ships with the skill; copy it to `<wiki>/CLAUDE.md` on `init` and grow as papers are added.

### Vocabulary discipline

When the agent adds tags during any `log` operation:

1. **Look up** each candidate value against the vocabulary file. Use case-insensitive alias-aware matching.
2. **If known**: use the canonical slug (NOT the user's spelling).
3. **If unknown**: STOP. Propose a vocabulary diff to the user with a definition and suggested aliases. Apply only after explicit approval. Then update the page.

This is non-negotiable. **Never invent a tag silently.** The cost of a stop-and-ask is small; the cost of a polluted vocabulary compounds for years.

Escape hatch: an `uncategorized` slug is reserved across all axes for genuinely-novel content where the user wants to defer categorization. `lint` will report when uncategorized usage exceeds 30% of any axis (signal that taxonomy needs work).

## Wiki layout

```
<wiki>/
├── CLAUDE.md / AGENTS.md      # ⭐ vocabulary + per-wiki style overrides
├── profile.md                 # ⭐ auto-loaded one-pager (AUTO + manual sections)
├── index.md                   # navigation hub (manual; links into index/ tree)
├── log.md                     # chronological append-only log
├── projects/{active,paused,done}/
├── papers/{published,submitted,drafts,rejected}/
│   └── *.md + *.private.md    # ALWAYS paired: public stub + private companion
├── ideas/{promising,parked,killed}/
├── methods-mine/
├── failures/                  # ⭐ what didn't work and why
├── collaborators/
├── talks/  reviews/  snapshots/  funding/
└── index/                     # ⭐ AUTO-generated by update-index, do not hand-edit AUTO blocks
    ├── by-method/<slug>.md
    ├── by-observable/<slug>.md
    ├── by-codes/<slug>.md
    ├── by-topic/<slug>.md     ← also serves as your "research line" page
    ├── by-system/<slug>.md
    └── by-collaborator/<slug>.md
```

**Important**: `index/by-topic/<topic>.md` and `index/by-method/<method>.md` doubly serve as **research-line pages**. They have a hand-written preamble (motivation, key insight, current state, "is this line still alive?") above the AUTO block, which lists papers / ideas / failures / methods carrying that tag. There is no separate `lines/` page type — a topic that has 3+ papers IS a research line.

## Common frontmatter

Every non-profile page carries:

```yaml
---
type: project | paper | idea | failure | method | collaborator | talk | review | funding
status: <type-specific; see per-page schemas>
created: YYYY-MM-DD
last_updated: YYYY-MM-DD
sensitivity: public | private | embargoed   # default private

# Tag axes (use vocabulary canonical slugs only; ask before adding new vocab)
methods: []
observables: []
codes: []
topics: []
systems: []
collaborators: []

# Lineage (papers / projects / ideas; optional otherwise)
predecessor: [[other-page]]
successor: [[other-page]]
companion: [[other-page]]

# Profile featuring (optional override)
featured: false   # if true, force this onto profile.md regardless of activity heuristics

# Cross-link into literature-wiki (when relevant)
literature: [[../research-wiki/methods/<slug>]]
---
```

## Per-page schemas

### project (active | paused | done)

- Path: `projects/<status>/<slug>.md`
- Frontmatter: common + tag axes
- Required body:
  - `## Goal` — one paragraph
  - `## Methods used` — links to vocabulary slugs and `methods-mine/`
  - `## Current state` — what works, what doesn't, what's blocking
  - `## Code/repo` — absolute paths, including server (e.g. `heliumx:/scratch/jin/...`)
  - `## Collaborators` — slugs (vocabulary-controlled) + role each
  - `## Related literature` — links to `research-wiki/sources/` if literature-wiki installed
- Affects profile.md: yes if status=active OR featured=true.

### paper (published | submitted | drafts | rejected) — schema v2

The paper schema is the most-revised in v2. Key principle: **if a section can be reconstructed from the abstract a year from now, do not include it**. The wiki page captures what the abstract cannot.

- Path: `papers/<status>/<slug>.md` (public, safe to commit) **paired with** `papers/<status>/<slug>.private.md` (always created, gitignored by `*.private.md`).
- Frontmatter (paper-specific extras on top of common):
  - `title:`, `authors: [list, lead first]`
  - `submitted:` `first_decision:` `accepted:` `published:` (YYYY-MM-DD; optional per state)
  - `doi:`, `arxiv:`, `venue:`
  - tag axes (mandatory — at least one method, one topic, one system)
  - `predecessor:` / `companion:` / `successor:` lineage links
- Required body sections in `<slug>.md` (public):
  1. **`## Key claim`** — one sentence DEEPER than the abstract. The abstract has the claim; this is the claim with the actual hedge or qualifier the abstract glossed over.
  2. **`## My contribution`** — CRediT-style breakdown. Required structure: Conceptualization / Methodology / Software / Formal analysis / Writing — original draft / Writing — review. Mark each as "Lead | Equal | Contributing | Not involved" with the responsible co-author named for the lead-other items.
  3. **`## Code and data location`** — absolute paths including server hostname (e.g. `heliumx:/scratch/jin/cdcc-19/run42/`). Future-you will need this within 18 months.
  4. **`## Lineage`** — prose narrative of how this paper extends predecessor and what the next step is. Frontmatter has the links; body has the story.
  5. **`## Key numbers worth remembering`** — specific numerical results with their context (e.g. "epsilon = 0.27 ± 0.03 at Ec.m. = 38 MeV; matches m_pi/Lambda_chi = 0.28 (Sec. III.B)").
  6. **`## What I'd do differently now`** — future-self letter. Often becomes the seed of the successor paper.
- `<slug>.private.md` (companion, embargoed): see schema below.
- Affects profile.md: yes if status=published (last 24 months) OR status=submitted OR featured=true.

### paper.private (always create alongside paper)

- Path: `papers/<status>/<slug>.private.md`
- Frontmatter: `sensitivity: embargoed`, `paper: [[<slug>]]`
- Optional body sections (write as needed; the file slot is always created on `log paper`):
  - `## Reviewer N` — incoming reports, with date, journal, decision, verbatim quotes
  - `## Response drafts` — your reply text in progress
  - `## Internal correspondence` — slack/email summaries with co-authors about the paper
  - `## Co-author disagreements` — frank notes, who pushed back on what
- The public `<slug>.md` should cross-link with: `See [[<slug>.private]] for embargoed material.`
- **Never auto-quoted** to outputs that could leak (chat with non-private MCPs, public artifacts) without explicit user OK.

### idea (promising | parked | killed)

- Path: `ideas/<status>/<slug>.md`
- Frontmatter: common + tag axes
- Required body:
  - `## Seed thought` — what triggered it
  - One of `## Why promising` | `## Why parked` | `## Why killed` (matching status)
  - `## What would unblock it` (for promising/parked)
  - `## Relevant literature` — links into research-wiki when applicable
- **Killed ideas MUST include `## Why killed`** with concrete reason. Highest-value field for AI context: it prevents the agent from suggesting paths the user has already burned.
- Affects profile.md: killed ideas are surfaced under the auto "Strong opinions / dead ends" section; promising ideas surface only if `featured=true`.

### failure

- Path: `failures/<slug>.md`
- Frontmatter: common + tag axes (mandatory at least one method, one topic, one system — failures need to be findable by the same axes as papers)
- Required body:
  - `## What was tried`
  - `## Why it should have worked` — your prior belief
  - `## What actually happened` — observation
  - `## What was ruled out` — corollary findings
  - `## Conditions that might revive it` — when to revisit
- Affects profile.md: top 5 most informative are auto-surfaced under "Strong opinions / dead ends".

### method (mine)

- Path: `methods-mine/<slug>.md`
- Frontmatter: common + tag axes + `language` + `code_repo` + `license`
- Required body:
  - `## What it does` — one paragraph
  - `## Key API surface`
  - `## Gotchas`
  - `## Papers using it` — wikilinks (kept manually as a sanity check; auto-index also generates by-codes/<slug>.md)
- Affects profile.md: yes if status=active OR maintained.

### collaborator / talk / review (outgoing) / funding

(Compact; same shape as v1, with tag axes added.)

- **collaborator**: `collaborators/<slug>.md`. Frontmatter extras: `role: close|occasional|past`, `institution`, `expertise: [tags]`, `sensitivity: private` default. Body: `## How we met`, `## Common projects`, `## Communication preferences`, optional `## Frank notes` (sensitivity-gated).
- **talk**: `talks/<YYYY>-<slug>.md`. Frontmatter extras: `venue`, `date`, `audience_level`, `public_url`. Body: `## Topic`, `## Key slides/figures`, `## What I'd change next time`.
- **review (outgoing)**: `reviews/<YYYY>-<slug>.md`. Always `sensitivity: embargoed`. Body: `## Paper summary`, `## My verdict`, `## Key concerns`, `## Lessons`.
- **funding**: `funding/<YYYY>-<slug>.md`. Frontmatter extras: `agency`, `status: submitted|awarded|rejected`, `amount`, `period`, `role`. Body: `## Project summary`, `## Key claims`, `## Deadlines`.

## Operations

### 1. `init` — first-time setup

Privileged-write operation; each side effect gated by confirmation.

1. **Resolve and confirm wiki path.** Default `~/research-wiki-personal/`. Stop if user declines.
2. **Create directory skeleton.** Copy `templates/profile.md` → `<wiki>/profile.md`, `templates/.gitignore` → `<wiki>/.gitignore`, `templates/CLAUDE.md` → `<wiki>/CLAUDE.md` (vocabulary starter), create empty `index.md` and `log.md`. Run `git init`.
3. **Wire auto-load (idempotent).** Detect harness (Claude Code presence at `~/.claude/`, Codex at `~/.codex/`). For each detected harness:
   - Claude Code: `grep -Fxq` for the import line in `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md` first; skip if present, else show diff and ask before appending.
   - Codex: inspect `~/.codex/AGENTS.md`. If absent, create symlink. If symlinked to same target, skip. If symlinked elsewhere, ask before overwriting. If a regular file with content, offer cancel / merge-into-profile.md / `.bak`-then-overwrite. Apply with `ln -sfn` for idempotence.
4. **Idempotent re-init.** If `<wiki>/profile.md` already exists, skip Step 2 and run only Step 3 (lets you wire a second harness on an existing wiki).
5. **Recommend next.** Set a private remote, fill `profile.md`, review `.gitignore`, optionally install pre-commit hook from `templates/pre-commit-hook.sh`.

### 2. `log` — capture a new entry

Trigger: `记一下`, `加进档案`, `log this`, `我有个 idea`, `这次没 work`.

**For type=paper, FIRST split:** ask "is this your paper or one you read?" (cache the answer in session). If "one you read", **HAND OFF** to literature-wiki: invoke its `ingest` operation with the source, then write a thin stub at `papers/read/<slug>.md` (only created if the user opts in) that cross-links to `research-wiki/sources/<paper-id>.md`. The detail lives there, not here.

For other types, or for "your paper":

1. Identify entry type from user phrasing. Ask once if ambiguous.
2. **Vocabulary check** for all tag axes the user mentioned. For unknown values, propose vocab diff first; do not silently invent.
3. Create the page at the path specified by its schema, with all required frontmatter and body sections present (sections can be sparse on first creation).
4. For papers: ALWAYS also create the `<slug>.private.md` companion stub (with `sensitivity: embargoed`), even if empty.
5. Append a one-line entry to `log.md`: `## [YYYY-MM-DD] log | <type> | <slug> | <one-line>`.
6. Update `index.md` (the manual hub).
7. **Trigger `update-index`** to refresh affected `index/by-<axis>/<tag>.md` pages.
8. Ask: should `profile.md` be refreshed? (Heuristic: yes if the new entry could affect the auto sections per "Affects profile.md" annotations above.)

### 3. `update-profile` — refresh the auto-loaded one-pager

profile.md is split into AUTO blocks (rewritten by this operation) and manual blocks (never touched). AUTO block boundaries:

```markdown
<!-- AUTO:BEGIN active-research-lines -->
<!-- AUTO:END -->

<!-- AUTO:BEGIN recent-publications -->
<!-- AUTO:END -->

<!-- AUTO:BEGIN methods-i-own -->
<!-- AUTO:END -->

<!-- AUTO:BEGIN dead-ends -->
<!-- AUTO:END -->
```

#### Active-research-lines algorithm

```
for tag in topics + methods:
    pages = wiki pages tagged with tag whose status is "active" or "published in last 36 months"
    if len(pages) >= 3 AND any(updated within last 12 months):
        yield (tag, latest_update_date)
sort by latest_update_date desc
take top 5
also include any page with featured=true (override)
```

Each entry in this AUTO block is a one-line summary with a wikilink to `index/by-topic/<tag>.md` (the research-line page).

#### Recent-publications algorithm

`papers/published/*` with `published` date in last 24 months, sorted desc. One line per paper.

#### Methods-i-own algorithm

`methods-mine/*` with status `active` OR `maintained`. One line per method.

#### Dead-ends algorithm

`failures/*` sorted by `last_updated` desc, take top 5. One line per failure with the "Why X did not work" excerpt.

Flow:
1. Compute all four AUTO sections from current wiki state.
2. Read existing profile.md, locate AUTO markers.
3. If the user has hand-edited content INSIDE an AUTO block, warn and offer: discard manual edits / convert to a new manual section above the AUTO block.
4. Replace AUTO blocks atomically; manual sections are untouched.
5. Show diff. Ask before saving.

### 4. `update-index` — refresh the tag-indexed pages

Triggered automatically after every `log`, after `update-profile`, after `migrate`, and after `lint`. Can also be invoked explicitly. Always idempotent.

Flow:
1. Walk all pages under `projects/`, `papers/`, `ideas/`, `failures/`, `methods-mine/`, `collaborators/`, `talks/`, `reviews/`, `funding/`. Read frontmatter only (cheap).
2. Build an in-memory tag → pages map for each axis. Apply `parent:` propagation (a page tagged `iav-cdcc` is also indexed under `cdcc`).
3. For each (axis, tag) pair, write `<wiki>/index/by-<axis>/<tag>.md`:

```markdown
# <Canonical name from vocabulary>

<!-- MANUAL preamble (above AUTO marker; preserved across runs) -->

<!-- AUTO:BEGIN -->

## Papers (<count>)
- [YYYY] *Title* — Key claim excerpt. → [[../../papers/published/<slug>]]
  Cross-tags: methods=[…], topics=[…], systems=[…]

## Failures (<count>)
- [YYYY] What didn't work, one-line. → [[../../failures/<slug>]]

## Open ideas (<count>)
- [YYYY] Seed thought. → [[../../ideas/promising/<slug>]]

## Methods I own (<count>)
- <slug> — what it does. → [[../../methods-mine/<slug>]]

<!-- AUTO:END -->
```

4. Skip pages with `sensitivity: embargoed` from indices unless the index file is itself in a private-only directory (rare; default behavior: embargoed pages are NOT linked from auto indices to prevent leak via index summary).
5. Delete `<wiki>/index/by-<axis>/<tag>.md` files whose tag has zero pages (after this run).
6. Report what was added / changed / removed.

### 5. `snapshot` — CV-style export

Read-only synthesis grouped by year. Pulls from frontmatter dates and key claims. Optionally save to `snapshots/YYYY-MM-DD-<scope>.md` (gitignored by default).

### 6. `lint` — health check

Trigger: explicit, or suggest after every ~20 logs.

Checks:
- Active projects with no update in 90+ days → propose move to `paused/`.
- Papers in `submitted/` for >120 days → flag for status check.
- Ideas in `promising/` for >180 days with no movement → propose `parked/` or `killed/`.
- `profile.md` `last_updated` >60 days → propose `update-profile`.
- Pages where required schema sections are missing.
- **Vocabulary integrity**: pages using tags not in vocabulary; vocabulary entries with no pages using them; uncategorized usage > 30% of any axis.
- **AUTO marker integrity**: AUTO blocks with hand-written content inside (warns user); profile.md missing AUTO markers (after migrate).
- **Cross-link validity**: `predecessor` / `successor` / `literature` wikilinks pointing to non-existent pages.
- **Lineage cycles**: A → B → A in predecessor / successor chains.

Output: a markdown report. Apply fixes only after the user reviews.

### 7. `migrate` — bring existing pages up to current schema

Use when upgrading from v1 (no controlled vocab, simpler frontmatter) to v2.

Flow:
1. Walk all pages.
2. For each page, identify missing v2 fields (tag axes, lineage, paper-private companion, schema body sections).
3. For each gap, prompt user: "Page `<path>` is missing tag axis `methods`. From the page content, I propose `[cdcc, iav-cdcc]` (existing vocab) — confirm or correct."
4. For papers without `<slug>.private.md`: create empty companion with frontmatter only.
5. After the page is brought to v2: re-write to disk, append migration entry to `log.md`.
6. After full pass: run `update-index` once.

This is interactive and slow on a large wiki — that's intentional. The user must validate each tag application; silent migration would defeat the purpose of controlled vocabulary.

## Working principles

- **Privacy and the model round-trip.** profile.md content is sent to the model provider on every session start. Keep profile.md free of embargo-sensitive specifics. Pages with `sensitivity: embargoed` are never auto-quoted to outputs that could leak.
- **Capture, don't curate, on the way in.** Polish only on `update-profile` cycles.
- **Failures are first-class.** Failure pages get the same tag axes as papers; the auto-index treats them as equal-rank entries for "what have I done on topic X".
- **Controlled vocabulary is a contract.** Never invent tags silently; always check vocab; new tags require explicit user approval. Tag drift breaks indexing for years; the cost of asking is small.
- **Frontmatter is the index, body is the narrative.** Cross-cutting queries hit frontmatter only; the body is for human reading and depth.
- **Cross-link into the literature-wiki** when it exists. Use `literature:` frontmatter and inline `[[../research-wiki/...]]` links.
- **Read the wiki's `CLAUDE.md` / `AGENTS.md` first** for vocabulary and personal style overrides.

## Cross-skill hand-off with literature-wiki

When the user reads a paper that relates to their own work:
1. The paper goes to **literature-wiki** (`research-wiki/sources/<paper-id>.md`) — the field-level record.
2. If it informs an active project, idea, or failure here, add a `literature: [[../research-wiki/sources/<paper-id>]]` line to the relevant page's frontmatter, plus a one-sentence note in body explaining the relevance.
3. If the read paper has a method that's also in this user's work, the method tag in vocabulary should be the same slug across both wikis (vocabulary file at the user-level, e.g. `~/research-vocabulary.yml`, can be symlinked into both `<personal-wiki>/CLAUDE.md` and `<literature-wiki>/CLAUDE.md` for true single source of truth — optional advanced setup).

When the user logs their own paper that uses a method documented in literature-wiki:
1. Page tagged with method slug as usual.
2. Add `literature: [[../research-wiki/methods/<method-slug>]]` to frontmatter.
3. The auto-index `<personal-wiki>/index/by-method/<method-slug>.md` adds a "See also: literature-wiki definition" line at the top.

## Detail on schema and workflows

The per-page schemas above are the contract. Templates ship in `templates/`:

- `templates/profile.md` — starter for the auto-loaded one-pager (with AUTO markers).
- `templates/CLAUDE.md` — vocabulary starter with empty axes and a few example entries.
- `templates/.gitignore` — privacy default.
- `templates/pre-commit-hook.sh` — optional Git pre-commit guard.

For extended workflows or schema variants, see `references/` if present.
